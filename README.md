Description of Files
--------------------

1. myfuzzycontrolsystem.ipynb
   - Implements a fuzzy control system using scikit-fuzzy.
   - Inputs: study_hours and sleep_hours; Output: predicted exam score.
   - Demonstrates fuzzy rules, membership functions, and surface visualization.

2. myfuzzyclustering.ipynb
   - Applies fuzzy c-means clustering to the same dataset.
   - Groups students into fuzzy performance clusters (low, medium, high).

3. fuzzy_students_120.csv
   - Dataset with 120 students: study_hours, sleep_hours, score.
   - Used as input for both notebooks.

4. requirements.txt
   - Lists Python dependencies to run both notebooks.

This work demonstrates fuzzy reasoning and fuzzy clustering principles
from the Fuzzy Sets and Systems I course. The control system models
human-like decision rules (IF–THEN), while clustering shows soft grouping
through fuzzy memberships.
